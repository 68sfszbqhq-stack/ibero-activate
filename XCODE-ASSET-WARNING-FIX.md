# ✅ Xcode Asset Warning Fixed

## Issue Resolved
**Warning:** "The image set 'Splash' has 3 unassigned children"

## What Was the Problem?

When you saw this warning in Xcode:
```
Assets.xcassets
└── The image set 'Splash' has 3 unassigned children.
```

This meant that the `Splash.imageset` folder contained **3 orphan image files** that weren't referenced in the `Contents.json` file. These were leftover files from when the splash screen assets were generated by `capacitor-assets`.

## Files Removed

The following unused files were deleted from `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/Splash.imageset/`:
- ❌ `splash-2732x2732.png`
- ❌ `splash-2732x2732-1.png`
- ❌ `splash-2732x2732-2.png`

## Current Clean State

The Splash.imageset now contains only the **7 files** that are properly referenced:

### Light Mode Splash Screens:
- ✅ `Default@1x~universal~anyany.png` (1x scale)
- ✅ `Default@2x~universal~anyany.png` (2x scale)
- ✅ `Default@3x~universal~anyany.png` (3x scale)

### Dark Mode Splash Screens:
- ✅ `Default@1x~universal~anyany-dark.png` (1x scale)
- ✅ `Default@2x~universal~anyany-dark.png` (2x scale)
- ✅ `Default@3x~universal~anyany-dark.png` (3x scale)

### Configuration:
- ✅ `Contents.json` (asset catalog metadata)

## What to Do Next

1. **In Xcode**, the warning should now be **gone**. If Xcode is still open:
   - Close the project (⌘ + Q)
   - Reopen it: `npx cap open ios`
   - The warning should no longer appear

2. **The "Copying shared cache symbols from iPhone" dialog** you saw is normal:
   - This happens the **first time** you connect a new iPhone or after an iOS update
   - It's Xcode downloading debugging symbols from your device
   - Just **wait for it to complete** (it can take 5-15 minutes)
   - You can click "Cancel" and continue working, but debugging will be limited

3. **Build and run** your app normally:
   - The splash screen will work perfectly
   - All 6 variants (3 light + 3 dark) are properly configured

## Verification

Run this command to verify the cleanup:
```bash
ls -la ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/Splash.imageset/
```

You should see exactly **7 files** (6 PNG images + 1 Contents.json).

## Why This Happened

The `capacitor-assets` tool sometimes generates extra files during the asset creation process. These files are:
- Not harmful
- Not used by Xcode
- But they trigger warnings in Xcode's asset validator

By removing them, we've cleaned up the project and eliminated the warning.
